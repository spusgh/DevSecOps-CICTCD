# DevSecOps-CICTCD
This repository provides end-to-end examples, templates, and best practices for implementing DevSecOps pipelines with integrated Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows. It demonstrates how to embed security, compliance, and reliability into every stage of the software delivery lifecycle.


## 🔑 Key Features
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform/CloudFormation modules for automated, secure provisioning

CI/CD Pipelines: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps workflows for build, test, and deploy

Security Integration: Static code analysis, dependency scanning, and container security checks

Observability: Logging, monitoring, and alerting configurations for resilient deployments

Policy Enforcement: Automated compliance checks and guardrails for cloud-native environments
